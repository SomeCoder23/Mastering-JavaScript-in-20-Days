## Day #13 of Mastering JavaScript
---

  ### The Learned Concepts:
- The lessons began with a a brief mention of the const keyword, and semantic errors that accompany its usage. Const is similar to let, however it does not let variables to be reassigned, though you could still change arrays. The instructor voiced his opinion about only ising them for immutable primitive values.
- The instructor explained the concept of hoisting, disproving some myths' about the subject like the saying "let doesn't hoist", he made it clear that let infact does hoist but instead of initializing the variable to undefined like var the variable exists but is uninitialized, he demonstrated how hoisting is described (what people usually think hoisting does), declaring that it is actually different from what really happens. He mentioned the majority's opinion on hoisting, which usually dislike var hoisting but claim function hoisting is pretty useful. The instructor also talked about the origin of the TDZ error, temporal dead zone, which was actually created beacause of const(so it can't hold two different values, undefined before assigned to value and then the value itself) and then implemented for let and var as well.
